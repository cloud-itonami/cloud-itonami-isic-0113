(ns vegops.store
  "SSoT for the vegetable/root-crop-growing operations coordinator,
  behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite --
  the same seam every prior cloud-itonami actor in this fleet uses
  (mirrors `cerealops.store`, cloud-itonami-isic-0111 -- the same
  domain family, already fixed):

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/vegops/store_contract_test.cljc).

  A registered field is the minimal unit of authority: a farm's field must
  be registered before ANY proposal referencing it can be considered by
  the Governor (see `vegops.governor`'s `field-registered` invariant).
  Field data is opaque to this namespace -- callers/backends decide what a
  field record contains (name, location, crop, acreage, etc); this Store
  only answers \"is this field-id registered, and if so what's on file\".
  Because the field payload shape is intentionally open, `DatomicStore`
  stores it as a single opaque EDN-blob attribute (`:field/payload`, via
  `langchain-store.core`'s `enc`/`dec*`) rather than expanding it into
  per-key Datomic attributes -- the same blob convention every sibling
  DatomicStore already uses for its own opaque payloads.

  The append-only audit ledger (`ledger`/`append-ledger!`) is this actor's
  core missing plumbing until now: `vegops.operation`'s `:commit`/`:hold`
  graph nodes append every committed/held/approval-rejected decision fact
  here, so a field's operating history (every `:log-field-record` /
  `:schedule-field-operation` / `:flag-crop-health-concern` /
  `:order-supplies` decision) is always a query over an immutable log --
  the same discipline every sibling actor's ledger provides. The ledger
  stays append-only on every backend."
