(ns vegops.store
  "Store abstraction for vegetable/root-crop field/planting records. Current
  implementation is an in-memory map; production should migrate to
  Datomic/kotoba-server (the same seam point all cloud-itonami actors
  use). Mirrors `cerealops.store` (cloud-itonami-isic-0111) in shape.

  A registered field is the minimal unit of authority: a farm's field must
  be registered before ANY proposal referencing it can be considered by
  the Governor (see `vegops.governor`'s `field-registered` invariant).
  Field data is opaque to this namespace -- callers/backends decide what a
  field record contains (name, location, crop, acreage, etc); this Store
  only answers \"is this field-id registered, and if so what's on file\".")
